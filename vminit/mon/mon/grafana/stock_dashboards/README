The dashboards in this directory come from two places.

(1) CockroachDB publishes four "starter" dashboards for observing CockroachDB in
    Grafana:

        https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/tree/master/monitoring/grafana-dashboards

    These are the source of "replicas.json", "runtime.json", "sql.json", and
    "storage.json".

(2) Grafana itself ships dashboards for monitoring itself and Prometheus.  In a
    built Grafana tarball, you can find this in
    ./public/app/plugins/datasource/prometheus/dashboards.

The dashboards in this directory have been modified in one small way: while the
stock dashboards are parametrized by the name of the datasource
("$DS_PROMETHEUS" for most of them, "$DS_NAME" for a few), this is not currently
supported for "provisioned" dashboards (which is what we're shipping here):

    https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/10786

So we have removed this "input" by hand (at the top of the file) and done a
simple find/replace of "${DS_PROMETHEUS}" and "${DS_NAME}" with "Prometheus",
which is the actual name of our Prometheus data source.
